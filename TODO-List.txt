TODO List
=========

X Include source file template name in generated file.  I.e. This was parsed output from XXX.palette
    - initWithParameters: on RMRColorCategoryBuilder and follow similar approach as the swift one.

- Option to specify the color space

X Option to specify OSX output (i.e. NSColor)
    X ObjectiveC as well!


X Allow for comments in the generated file  (Defined Colors (with hex codes), Aliases)

X Allow for comments in the markup file so that:
    X ObjectiveC too!

#SomeHexValue ColorName MyComments becomes

// #SomeHexValue: MyComments
static let colorName: UIColor = UIColor(named:"ColorName")!

or

// $ColorName: MyComments
static let colorName: UIColor = UIColor(named:"ColorName")!

X and have these be separated by whitespace, NOT just a space character
    X have to basically replace a string of whitespace with "" then get the components separated by ""
    X Should also look at the # parser code as it's different than the $ parser stuff (Regex)
